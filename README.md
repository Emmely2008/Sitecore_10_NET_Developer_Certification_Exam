If you would like additional information, this [article](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/101/platform-administration-and-architecture/index-update-strategies.html) can supplement the details provided in this guide.

- Because this strategy triggers a full index rebuild, you should combine it with [SwitchOnRebuildSolrSearchIndex](https://doc.sitecore.com/en/developers/101/platform-administration-and-architecture/switch-solr-indexes.html).
- You can use the [Knowledge Base](https://support.sitecore.com/kb) to troubleshoot problems, research known issues, or assess compatibility data for Sitecore products, modules, and platforms.


- Response time for Standard Support cases ranges from one to three business days, depending on the severity of the issue. For a more specific breakdown of response times, see this [article](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/583182).

- How to access the Support Portal - have an account registered under the individual's name (not a generic account) at [https://profile.sitecore.net](https://profile.sitecore.net/), and ...


- Sitecore Managed Cloud service requests go to Sitecore's Cloud Operations Team and must address a specific item in the [service catalog](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0137210). 

- Note: Sitecore can update life cycle phases at any time. More information about [Sitecore Product Support Lifecycle](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0641167) is available through Knowledge Base.

- See this [article](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0406145) if you need details on how to collect basic information about your Sitecore installation.

- Including this information allows the Support Team to work on multiple support cases as a single group, thus making the resolution process timelier. If you need additional details, this [article](https://kb.sitecore.net/articles/073804) can help you.

- Note: For more information on how to register your Sitecore license, read this [article](https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0073804#HowToRegisterLicenseUsingLicenseXMLFile).
